Title:
A Time Series Analysis of Species Abundance in Latin America and The Caribbean Before and After the Ratification of the international Convention on Biological Diversity

Background:

Over time, the relative abundance of many animal species has been decreasing due to a variety of factors, such as overhunting, habitat loss, and climate change.
In response to these trends, countries around the world have passed both internal legislation to protect at-risk populations,
as well as formed international agreements with other countries in order to address the problem of biodiversity loss.
While not necessarily legally binding, international agreements represent a significant effort by member countries to work together towards the common goal of
preserving biodiversity. This is especially important when there is no physical boundary separating countries, as species can travel freely between them and
subsequently be subject to different laws regarding their protection. One of these international agreements which will be the focus of this project is the
Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), which covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources found in the world.
